# PIT
PL/SQL Instrumentation Toolkit

Hi everybody,
this is the home of PIT, the PL/SQL Instrumentation Toolkit.
This tool is designed to help you manage your 
  - exceptions
  - debug information
  - trace information
  - assertion functions
  - user messages
within a single package, with a single API and least possible code.

Yet, PIT gives you
  - unlimited number of different output channels to write messages to
  - full i18n support, messages are translatable using a XLIFF file and an open source editor
  - possibility to maintain a full call stack with timing and cpu-timing option
  - simple api with least possible code
  
The code is free to use and I hope that you'll enjoy doing so. Should any errors occur, 
feel free to describe them here.

Best regards,

JÃ¼rgen Sieben
